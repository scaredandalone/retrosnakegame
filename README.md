**Python Snake Game in Pyxel**

This Python-based game, developed using the Pyxel library, offers a classic Snake gaming experience with several key features:

 **Object-Oriented Design:** 
  - Organizes game elements into classes such as SnakeSection, Apple, Level, and Hud, following object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.
  - Enhances modularity, encapsulation, and code reuse.

 **Game States:** 
  - Features three main states: STARTUP, RUNNING, and GAME_OVER.
  - Controls different aspects of the game's behavior, from initialization to gameplay and end conditions.

 **Input Handling:** 
  - Efficiently manages player input for controlling the snake's movement using directional keys.
  - Allows toggling of music during gameplay for a personalized experience.

  **Collision Detection:** 
  - Implements logic to detect collisions between the snake and itself, walls, or apples.
  - Triggers appropriate actions such as game over or snake growth upon collision.

 **Graphics and UI:** 
  - Utilizes Pyxel for graphics rendering, providing simple sprite-based visuals.
  - Incorporates a Heads-Up Display (HUD) to display essential game information like score, level, and apples eaten.

  **Game Loop:** 
  - Follows a typical game loop structure with an update function managing game logic and a draw function rendering the game state.

  **Unfinished Elements**
 - Level and Score system are currently non-functional and do not contribute to gameplay.
